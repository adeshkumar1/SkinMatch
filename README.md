SkinMatch was a finalist in the Hack Knights cohort at HackIllinois 2024.

SkinMatch is a novel personalized skincare routine generator made with custom-trained YoloV8 models, a product finder made with Pinecone vector DB. We used React, TailwindCSS, and Flask to connect our front end to the API and we used Kaggle for our datasets.
